A Scala wrapper for [Joda Money](http://www.joda.org/joda-money/), in
the same vein as the
[nscala-time](https://github.com/nscala-time/nscala-time) wrapper for
Joda Time. An optional helper for Play JSON is available.

| Name | Description | Scaladoc |
|------|-------------|----------|
|`nscala-money`|Pure Scala Wrapper|[API](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.nscala-money/nscala-money_2.11)|
|`nscala-money-play-json`|Play JSON `Reads/Writes`|[API](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.nscala-money/nscala-money-play-json_2.11/)|

## Installation

Add the following to your sbt build (Scala 2.10.x, and Scala 2.11.x):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.nscala-money" %% "nscala-money" % "0.12.2"
```

To support reading and writing JodaMoney objects using Play JSON, also add (Scala 2.10.x and Scala 2.11.x):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.nscala-money" %% "nscala-money-play-json" % "0.12.2"
```

If you want to use previous versions, you can find them [here](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.github.nscala-money%22).

## Usage

This is mostly a convenience wrapper around the Joda Money libraries, adding more pleasant syntax like operators for addition, subtraction, and comparison. Also, most fields usually available as `getField` are now simply available as `field`, following Scala convention.  Some instances of `asX` or `toX` have also been shortened.

The `nscala-money-play-json` helper adds support for Play JSON.
Various `Reads` and `Writes` for `CurrencyUnit`, `Money`, and
`BigMoney` are provided.

### Import
```scala
import com.github.nscala_money.money.Imports._

// For optional Play JSON support
import com.github.nscala_money.money.json.PlayImports._
```

### Money Operations
```scala
"USD 10.99".toMoney // returns org.joda.money.Money

"USD".toCurrency // returns org.joda.money.CurrencyUnit

"USD 10.99".toMoney + "USD 1.00".toMoney // returns org.joda.money.Money = USD 11.99
```

## Acknowledgements

This wrapper library is intended to do for Joda Money what
`nscala-time` does for Joda Time. The project structure and much of
the boilerplate (including this README) were taken directly from
`nscala-time`.
